Repeatmasker repeat annotations for the northern genome assembly


ww_augustus_new_names.filt.gff3.gz:

gff3 file containing augustus gene models in the northern genome assembly. The original augustus dataset has been filtered to include
only protein coding genes containing some match to other proteins or containing predicted domains. If applicable, genes have been
named based on the chicken genome annotation (GRCg6a). When no associated name (e.g. RYR2) was found in the putative 
chicken orthologue, the gene has instead been assigned an Ensembl gene identifier (e.g. ENSGALG00000022804).


ww_webapollo_annotations_20200221.gff3.gz: 

This file contains manually curated annotations of protein-coding genes in the regions on chromosome 1 (Scaffold156)
chromosome 3 (Scaffold29 > 55.72 Mb) and chromosome 5 (Scaffold68) in the northern assembly. Note that this file also contains
annotations in the rest of the genome that have not been curated but could have been modified when imported into Webapollo.
